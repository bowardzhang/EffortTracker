# EffortTracker
Website for tracking work effort

Program based on Django, made adaptations based on https://github.com/sydjameer/Effort-Tracker.

It is not perfect but contains the basic features such as 
- An admin user can browse and change the entire database, such as checking existing effort records and create new project work entries.
- A normal user can book effort on existing project work, and view his/her effort records.
